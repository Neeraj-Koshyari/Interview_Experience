  First they both introduces them self and then i introduced my self.
  Then started with one Amazon Principle question: What was the time you learn something like from your projects, current training etc.
  
Then Came 2 coding Question:
  1. Given a number n in the form of string (0 < length(n) < 1e5). Your task is to find whether the number is divisible by 12 or not.
  A number x is divisible by y if x mod y is equal to 0.

  Sample:
  Input - 4
  Output - False

  Input - 48
  Output - True

    -> Solved and explained (till here from the start of the meeting 30 min gone (5:30 PM))

  2. Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/detonate-the-maximum-bombs/description/
    Amazon operates a network of delivery hubs across different cities. Each hub has a service coverage radius within which it can 
      activate and coordinate other hubs. When a hub is activated, it can automatically trigger activation of all hubs that fall 
      within its services coverage area.
      
      Each hub is represented as a 2D integer array hubs where hubs[i] = [xi, yi, ri].
      *  (xi, yi) denotes the geographical coordinates of the hub.
      *  ri denotes the coverage radius of that hub.

      You may choose to activate only one hub initially. Once activated, that hub can trigger all other hubs within its coverage. Those
      hubs can further trigger the hubs within their coverage, and so on.
      
      Your task is to determine:
        What is the maximum number of hubs that can be activated if you are allowed to start with only one hub?
        
        input: [[1,2,3],[2,3,1],[3,4,2],[4,5,3],[5,6,4]]
        output: 3

        Constraints:
        1 <= n <= 100
        1 <= xi,yi,ri <= 1e5

        -> Solved and explained with Brute Force solution but T.C. is O(n*n*log(n)) and the time was over (6:06 PM)

    -> Interviewer(Anutosh): Any question:
        -> What were the expatation from the candidates for this role? (sde1 -> dsa + amazon principle, sde2 - > dsa + system design + amazon principle)
        -> What should i do for landing a job in Fang Company (DSA, CP, contest)
        -> Any Feedback (feedback against the amazon polices)


Result : Rejected (mail on 16 SEP 2025)
